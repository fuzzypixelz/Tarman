# Tarman

## What's in a name?

> **Tar**ball **man**ager. I know .. very creative :^)

And no, it's not a Living Dead reference. I didn't even know the franchise existed before typing "Tarman" into my search engine.

## Huh?

A command-line tool to manage random tarballs from the internet. 
This implies a convenient way to install, uninstall and update such software.

## Yet another package manager?

The purpose of `Tarman` is to automatically manage software that lives behind a URL somewhere on the internet. 

You should not need to write a package description. This is because we're aiming for the kind of self-contained binaries you would find on GitHub Releases for example.
